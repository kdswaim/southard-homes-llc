 <p>Thrive West Central on Thursday conducted a ribbon-cutting 
 ceremony for the Terre Vista Glen project on Ferndale Drive in 
 Terre Haute.</p>
 <p>This project is part of the Homes for the Future Program, a pilot initiative for home builders and developers 
 to incentivize them to build new, age-friendly homes in west central Indiana.</p>
 <p>The Terre Vista Glen Project is led by Billy Southard of Southard Homes LLC. It will add ten new single-family homes on the east side of Terre Haute. These stick-built homes will range from 1,600 to 2,100 square feet with three to four bedrooms and two to three full bathrooms each.</p>
 <p>These homes are located in an established subdivision next to two parks that can be accessed by the conveniently adjacent bike and foot trail.</p>
 <p>The Homes for the Future Program is made possible through the funding provided by the state’s READI 1.0 program. This project is a collaboration   of the investment made by the Wabash River Regional Development Authority and the Indiana Economic Development Corp. with support from the Terre Haute mayor’s office, Vigo County commissioners and both city and county councils.</p>
 <p>The Terre Vista project was awarded $120,000 as part of the Homes for the Future program.</p>
