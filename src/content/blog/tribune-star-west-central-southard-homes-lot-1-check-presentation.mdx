  <p>“Community partners celebrated the successful completion of the Southard Homes Infill 
  Project No. 1 Monday morning, marking a major milestone in the region’s Homes for the 
  Future Program.</p>
  <p>Those partners included Thrive West Central, Southard Homes LLC, the Wabash River 
  Regional Development Authority, the city of Terre Haute and Vigo County.</p>
  <p>The development includes 15 new, energy-efficient, single-family homes on previously 
  vacant lots throughout the city. Developed by Billy Southard of Southard Homes, 
  each includes three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, and ranges from 1,100 to 1,200 square 
  feet. All 15 have been sold.</p>
  <p>“This project is a testament to the power of local and regional collaboration,” said 
  Ryan Keller, CEO of Thrive West Central.</p>
  <p>The project was made possible by funding from READI 1.0 and reflected the shared 
  commitment of local, regional, and state partners.</p>
  <p>During the celebration, attendees heard remarks from Mayor Brandon Sakbun, Thrive West 
  Central's Keller, builder Southard, and Bill Rennels from the Wabash River RDA.</p>
  <p>Thrive West Central says it is leveraging over $25.7 million in private sector development 
  with awards of $952,500 in the READI Homes for the Future Program."</p>
