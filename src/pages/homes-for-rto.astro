        Let us guess: You can afford steep monthly rent but not a lower monthly home payment?
        <br/>
        We can't help you make sense of the housing market, but we can get you closer where you want to be: owning a home. <br/>

        We offer a 15-year contract for our RTO homes, and the house is yours upon completion. <br/>

        We buy local properties and bring them to their property glory thanks to our other Quality Companies: Quality Roofing of Indiana LLC, Quality Electric of Indiana LLC, and Quality Excavating of Indiana LLC.
    <br/>
    And with our team of trusted local vendors, Southard Homes LLC has everything we need to get the job done.
    <br/>
